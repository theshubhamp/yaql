YAQL: Yet Another Query Language (Implemented in Rust!)
================================

YAQL (Yet Another Query Language) is an embeddable and extensible query
language, that allows performing complex queries against arbitrary objects. It
has a vast and comprehensive standard library of frequently used querying
functions and can be extend even further with user-specified functions. YAQL is
originally written in python but this repository contains a feature equivalent (still WIP!) Rust port.
